## Adding a new side quest
1. Duplicate `_template.qmd` in `side-quests/entries/` and give it a descriptive name.
2. Update the YAML header with the side quest title, optional thumbnail, and publication date.
3. Write a short summary in Markdown. You can embed code blocks, images, or external links as needed.

The listing below will automatically update whenever you add a new `.qmd` file to `side-quests/entries/`.
