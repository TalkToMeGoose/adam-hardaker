## Adding a new project
1. Duplicate `_template.qmd` in `projects/entries/` and give it a descriptive name.
2. Update the YAML header with the project title, optional thumbnail, and publication date.
3. Write a short summary in Markdown. You can embed code blocks, images, or external links as needed.
