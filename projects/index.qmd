Here’s where I stash experiments, prototypes, and side quests that don’t quite fit a formal publication yet.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Adding a new experiment
1. Duplicate `_template.qmd` in `projects/entries/` and give it a descriptive name.
2. Update the YAML header with the experiment title, optional thumbnail, and publication date.
3. Write a short summary in Markdown. You can embed code blocks, images, or external links as needed.

The listing below will automatically update whenever you add a new `.qmd` file to `projects/entries/`.
